/**
 * Encode a Launchpad S [r, g] tuple (each 0..3) into a single MIDI velocity byte.
 *
 * Launchpad S LED encoding notes:
 * - Both red and green intensities are 2-bit values (0..3).
 * - The device expects them packed into a single velocity:
 *     velocity = BASE_OFFSET + (green << 4) + red
 * - Special case: [0,0] must map to velocity 0 for a true LED OFF.
 *   Without this, some hardware will display faint amber instead of off.
 *
 * Performance considerations:
 * - Hot path: called for every LED update, possibly many per frame.
 * - Uses bitwise ops and minimal branching to avoid allocations and keep
 *   CPU usage low.
